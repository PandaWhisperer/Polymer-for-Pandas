# Future Stack: Writing Modern Web Apps with CoffeeScript and Polymer

## Summary

Take a peek into the future of web applications! We go beyond MVC frameworks such as Angular or Backbone and dive into the world of Web Components, the newest HTML5 standard currently in review at the W3C.

You will learn the difference between component-based engineering and the MVC approach, and why the former is better suited to rapidly build complex GUI applications on the web. On the way, you will learn how to use Polymer, Google's newest frontend framework, to write clean and maintainable frontend code.

## Description

Take a peek into the future of web applications! We go beyond MVC frameworks such as Angular or Backbone and dive into the world of Web Components, the newest HTML5 standard currently in review at the W3C.

Component-based software engineering is not a new concept, but until now, it has never been possible on the web before. Various other solutions have been tried, such as jQuery plugins and MVC frameworks, but all have failed because they provide incomplete encapsulation.

In this talk, you will learn the difference between component-based engineering and the MVC approach, and why the former is better suited to rapidly build complex GUI applications on the web. On the way, you will learn how to use Polymer, Google's newest frontend framework, to write clean and maintainable frontend code.

You should have basic knowledge of front-end development, in other words, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or CoffeeScript. This talk will use CoffeeScript as the main language, but examples in JavaScript will be provided.
